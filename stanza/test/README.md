# Unit tests

The unit tests are tentatively based on Python's `unittest` framework. Please see existing unit tests for examples on
how to use the framework. Unit tests are hooked up to `setup.py` (eg. in the root folder) via the command `test`, which
will run all unit tests in this directory via auto-discovery. Hence to run all unit tests, go to the root folder and
type:

```
python setup.py test
```
